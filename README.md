Balancing a broomstick in an upright position requires coordinated horizontal movement of hand based on the visual queues. This nonlinear and inherently unstable control problem is often considered to be a primary benchmark for evaluating the performance and response of new control methods because of its structural simplicities. The same problem is also known as an inverted pendulum. A two-dimensional inverted pendulum consists of a vertical pole freely hinged to a platform which can be driven in the horizontal direction using a belt or cart system.
